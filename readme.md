## TWA1 - Lab 2 correction

### Steps
1. Start your server (athlete CRUD server). Server should be listening on port 3000
2. Run the correction script: `node correction.js` in this directory
3. Assess the results in the console output

### Output
Each use case should have a score /100. When the score is less than 100, there is supposed to be a feedback string with messages to help you figure out which part is problematic. If there are errors when running the script, it's probably because the server is sending back an error (status code 400-500) when it should not.
